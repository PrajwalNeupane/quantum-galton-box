Summary (‚âà500 words)
We implement a Quantum Galton Board (QGB) that maps a Galton box to a quantum circuit so a single circuit pass creates a superposition of all trajectories and samples a target distribution. This is a compact, intuitive playground for Monte-Carlo-style simulation on quantum hardware and a clean testbed for noise and mitigation in the NISQ era‚Äîrelevant to transport, finance, and uncertainty quantification. (Project scope per brief: general n-layer circuit; additional targets‚Äîexponential and Hadamard; noisy simulations; and distance metrics.) Project details

Objectives. (1) Generalize the QGB to n layers; (2) reproduce three targets‚ÄîHadamard walk, classical/binomial, and exponential; (3) build a robust benchmarking harness to compare noiseless vs. noisy runs with standardized post-processing and metrics (TVD, KL, Hellinger), plus leakage (mass off support) and integrity (fraction of one-hot strings).

Circuit design. We use a modular peg/shift construction closely following the reference QASM: prepare the coin, then apply controlled-SWAPs to realize left/right motion, repeated level-by-level. Our first pass showed a subtle right-bias; we fixed it by removing any CX(position‚Üícoin) and using proper control-on-0 branching, then consolidated into a symmetric ‚ÄúH-then-shift‚Äù step each level. We standardized endianness so '‚Ä¶001' is the rightmost bar and always measure only the position register. 

Targets.
‚Ä¢ Hadamard walk (n=4): a fixed 5-bin analytic distribution embedded on the 10-slot full grid (zeros in between bins).
‚Ä¢ Classical/binomial: verification target using ${n \choose k} / 2^n$

‚Ä¢ Exponential: per-peg Rx(Œ∏) biasing per as depth = level / total layers
 theta = arcsin(sqrt(1/(lam*n*depth))), n=total pegs given by triangle number 


Benchmarking. Our benchmark.py always post-processes to the full grid (raw bitstring length 
ùêø
L), embeds the analytic target onto that grid with zeros on ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù slots, and chooses offset parity by best match to the clean run. We report: TVD(noisy,clean), TVD/KL vs target, Hellinger(noisy,clean), plus leakage and integrity. This makes apples-to-apples comparisons across targets and seeds straightforward.

Representative baseline (n=4, seeds=8).

Exponential (Œª‚âà0.7): clean vs analytic TVD ‚âà 0.1910; noisy vs clean TVD ‚âà 0.2314; leakage_noisy ‚âà 0.0263; integrity_noisy ‚âà 0.4202.

Binomial: clean vs analytic TVD ‚âà 0.0046; noisy vs clean TVD ‚âà 0.1943; leakage_noisy ‚âà 0.1864; integrity_noisy ‚âà 0.3590.

Impact.

A reference-quality, symmetric QGB step that others can reuse; 2) a target-agnostic benchmarking harness with leakage/integrity, enabling measurable progress on noise optimization; 3) a clear path from circuits ‚Üí distributions for Monte-Carlo tasks.

Future scope. Optimize noisy accuracy and depth: smarter CSWAP decompositions and layout, dynamical decoupling, readout mitigation, transpiler tuning; per-layer Œ∏-calibration for exponential; and (time permitting) MCMR/RUS to discard corrupted shots. 2202.01735v1
